A catalog of my ECE 319H: Introduction to Embedded Systems Lab Projects at the University of Texas Austin 

## Academic Integrity Notice
- This repository is shared for educational and portfolio purposes only.
- If you are currently enrolled in ECE 319H or a similar course,
please do not copy this code directly.
- The programs in this catalog require MSMP0_Valvanoware to run properly. I have only included the files I wrote here.

## Overview
This repository contains my laboratory projects and programming assignments from ECE 319H: Introduction to Embedded Systems Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin.
The course focuses on:
- Microcontroller programming in C
- Memory-mapped I/O and low-level hardware interaction
- Interrupts, timers, and GPIO peripherals
- Real-time embedded system design and debugging
- Hardware–software integration using development boards and external components
Each lab demonstrates practical embedded systems concepts through hands-on firmware development, circuit integration, and testing.

## Technologies & Tools
### Programming
- C (embedded systems)
- ARM-based microcontroller architecture
### Hardware
- MSPM0 / ARM Cortex-M–based microcontroller development board
- LEDs, pushbuttons, sensors, and discrete components
- Breadboard prototyping and wiring
### Development Tools
-Code Composer Studio

## Learning Outcomes
Through these labs, I developed:
- Strong understanding of embedded C and low-level debugging
- Experience configuring GPIO, timers, and interrupts
- Ability to design deterministic real-time firmware
- Practical skills in hardware interfacing and signal control
- Structured approach to testing, validation, and documentation

These skills directly support my interests in:
- Embedded systems engineering
- Semiconductor / hardware-software co-design
- AI-enabled edge devices
- Real-time safety-critical systems
